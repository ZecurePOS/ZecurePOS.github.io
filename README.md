# ZecurePOS

ZecurePOS is a system for organising students grades. Since this is the repo of SSE-5G our main aspect in development will be security.
The goal of this Repo is to work as a website, so we can use SSH git push instead of ftp access (SSH is more secure).
The documentation is currently in our private google drive. Most of it will be moved here at some point in time.
